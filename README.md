# The-Best-Weather-app
This is the only weather app you will ever need. 
## Description 
This is a tiny weather app that allows the user to enter the name of a city, and then retrieve information on the weather for the current day, and for the next few days.
When the user enters the name of the city within the search field, they should get the temperature, humidity, and other values concerning the conditions of the day.
Once they search for one city, the search field should be cleared, and they can put in another city they want to get information on.
All the cities the user searches will be stored in the local storage, and on a list of previous searches will be displayed, so that the user can view the weather conditions again without having to do another search.
This is how this app is meant to work, however, at this stage there are still many components missing, that need to be refined and reworked.
